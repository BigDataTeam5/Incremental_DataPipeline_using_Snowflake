CO2 Data Pipeline
Overview
The CO2 Data Pipeline is designed to automate the ingestion, processing, analytics, and deployment of CO2 data. The pipeline leverages AWS S3, Snowflake, and GitHub to store, transform, and analyze CO2 data from 1974 to 2026. It includes harmonization, analytics, and orchestration components to generate valuable insights.

Architecture
The pipeline consists of the following stages:

Data Ingestion: Raw CO2 data is ingested from AWS S3 into Snowflake.
Harmonization: Data is cleaned and structured for further processing.
Analytics: Key metrics such as CO2 volatility and percent changes are calculated.
Deployment: Processed data and analytics outputs are stored and versioned on GitHub.
Orchestration: The pipeline is executed and monitored for seamless automation.
Technology Stack
AWS S3 – Data Storage
Snowflake – Data Warehouse
GitHub – Version Control & Deployment
Task Scheduling – Automation & Workflow Management
Setup & Execution Steps
Step 1: Initialize Setup
Run the setup scripts to configure the environment:
Execute render_setup.
Execute setup_dev.
Step 2: Ingest Raw CO2 Data
Load historical CO2 data for the years 1974-2020.
Process CO2 data streams for real-time updates.
Load future CO2 data for the years 2020-2026.
Step 3: Configure and Render YAML
Apply development configurations by executing render_yaml pass dev.
Step 4: Build and Deploy User-Defined Functions (UDFs)
Deploy UDFs required for CO2 analysis, including:
CO2 volatility calculation
Daily CO2 percent change
Weekly CO2 percent change
Normalization of CO2 data
Step 5: Build and Deploy Stored Procedures (SPs)
Deploy stored procedures for processing CO2 analytics and harmonization:
CO2 analytics processing
CO2 harmonization
CO2 data loading
Step 6: Orchestrate the Pipeline
Execute the pipeline workflow to process, analyze, and deploy the CO2 data.
Data Processing Workflow
Extract CO2 data from S3 and load it into Snowflake.
Transform data to harmonize formats and generate structured datasets.
Analyze key metrics using predefined analytics functions.
Deploy results to GitHub for tracking and reporting.
Monitor and optimize pipeline execution for performance improvements.
Future Enhancements
Implement real-time CO2 forecasting models.
Automate dashboard visualization for data trends.
Improve performance with distributed data processing.
